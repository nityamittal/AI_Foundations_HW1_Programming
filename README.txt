Answer 5.2 : Simulated Annealing Algorithm:
Simulated_Annealing_Algorithm.ipynb: Simulated annealing for N-Queens. 

Input: 
n: Number of queens (n = 8 for the 8-queen problem). 
iterations: Number of iterations (iterations = 100 as specified). 
schedule: Temperature schedule (schedule = T = 1 - t/100 as specified in the question).

Output: The average minimum number of conflicts (h) encountered during 2000 runs.

Answer 5.3 : Genetic Algorithm:
Genetic_Algorithm.ipynb: Genetic algorithm for N-Queens. 

Input: 
n: Number of queens (n = 8 for the 8-queen problem). 
population_size: Size of the population (population_size = 4 as specified in the question). 
iterations: Number of iterations (iterations = 100 as specified in the question). 
mutation_rate: Probability of mutation (mutation_rate = 0.1 as specified in the question).

Output: The average minimum number of conflicts (h) encountered during 2000 runs.
